# ShopLite RFC

## Overview
ShopLite is a lightweight e-commerce platform with ~10k SKUs and ~20k daily sessions.  
The platform focuses on helping users find products quickly and resolving support requests efficiently.  
This RFC captures the direction for AI-first features that directly impact conversion and support costs.

## Problem
- Product discovery is slowed down by keyword-only search.  
- Customer support is overloaded with repetitive questions (order status, refund policies).  
- Both lead to higher drop-off rates and higher support costs.

## Goals
- Increase conversion rate by improving search relevance.  
- Reduce support contact rate through automation.  
- Ensure AI use remains reliable, low-latency, and cost-effective.

## AI Touchpoints
