# Shoplite Knowledge Base (RAG Document Collection)
Each document below is intended as a standalone knowledge item in the RAG index. Use them as the embedded dataset in your notebook.

## Document 01: Shoplite User Registration Process
Shoplite supports two primary account types: Buyer and Seller. Buyers create a free account by providing an email address, choosing a password, and optionally entering a display name. Registration requires email verification; verification links expire after 24 hours. For password security, Shoplite enforces a minimum of 10 characters with at least one numeric and one special character. Users may enable 2FA via authenticator apps in account settings for stronger security. Account recovery uses verified email plus a time-limited token. Sellers must complete an expanded registration flow: business legal name, tax ID, business address, representative contact details, and bank account information for payouts. New seller accounts trigger a verification process: automated KYC checks plus manual review if checks flag inconsistencies. Seller verification typically completes in 2–3 business days; additional documentation may be requested for certain categories (electronics, cosmetics). Shoplite stores basic profile metadata (creation date, account type, last login) visible to the account holder. Account deletion requests are handled via settings and require confirmation emails; deleted accounts may have retention windows for records needed for compliance. The registration system exposes APIs for creating accounts and sending verification emails; rate limits apply per IP to prevent abuse.

## Document 02: Product Search and Filtering Features
Shoplite search is designed for scale and relevance. The platform supports keyword search, autocomplete (typeahead), semantic search (via embeddings), and advanced filtering. Product records include title, brand, category, price, availability, seller_id, rating, tags, and attributes (size, color). Filters are applied as conjunctive constraints; sorting options include relevance, price (low→high, high→low), newest arrivals, and top-rated. Typeahead uses prefix matching and a cached embedding-based fallback for synonyms and common typos. Search architecture: user query → tokenization → normalized string search → embedding-based re-rank → filter application → paginated results. For better performance, the system maintains per-category inverted indices and precomputed price buckets; category counts are approximate and updated via near-real-time pipelines. The product indexing pipeline accepts bulk updates from sellers and individual SKU updates via API. Search supports fuzzy matches (edit distance threshold), stemming for common languages, and localized price/currency. Admins can set "boost" rules to promote sponsored SKUs or high-margin products; these rules are applied post-retrieval. The search service exposes telemetry for query latency, click-through rates, and zero-result events for iterative tuning.

## Document 03: Shopping Cart and Checkout Process
The Shoplite cart persists items across sessions for logged-in users and for guests using a temporary cookie. Cart items store SKU id, seller id, quantity, unit price, and applied promotion metadata. The checkout flow is multi-step: address selection, shipping method, payment method, review & confirm. Shipping options are calculated per-seller and aggregated; Shoplite supports combined checkout when multiple sellers are involved, applies separate shipping charges, and computes the final total. Taxes are computed at checkout based on shipping address and product tax classifications; Shoplite integrates with tax-provider APIs for region-specific rules. Promo codes are applied during checkout with validation rules (stackability, expiration, min-spend). Payment methods supported: credit/debit cards (tokenized), direct bank transfer (ACH/SEPA), and third-party wallets (PayPal, Apple Pay). The platform uses PCI-compliant vaulting for card tokens; raw card data never touches Shoplite servers. Order creation occurs after payment authorization; in case of authorization failure the checkout returns a retry option. After successful checkout, an order confirmation email is sent with order ID and expected delivery windows. Abandoned cart flows are supported via scheduled emails if the user is logged in.

## Document 04: Payment Methods and Security
Shoplite supports multiple payment rails and prioritizes security and compliance. Card payments are processed with a PCI-DSS-certified gateway using tokenization and secure communication (TLS 1.2+). The system supports 3DS for regions where additional authentication is required. Stored payment methods are saved as gateway tokens that can be used for subsequent charges and subscriptions. For refunds, Shoplite implements an idempotent refund API allowing full and partial refunds mapped to original payment methods; merchants can issue refunds if the platform policy and settlement windows allow. For payment disputes/chargebacks, Shoplite collects evidence and helps merchants respond to disputes; contested funds may be placed on hold pending resolution. Sensitive operations are logged with masked values; full logs with PII require elevated access. The platform integrates with fraud detection providers (behavioral scoring, velocity checks) and applies rules (decline or require manual review) for high-risk transactions. For bank transfers and local payment methods, Shoplite provides reconciliation tools in accounting dashboards.

## Document 05: Order Tracking and Delivery
Once an order is created, Shoplite assigns a tracking workflow. Each shipment is assigned a tracking id and carrier; carriers are selected by sellers or via integrated shipping APIs. Estimated delivery times shown to customers are carrier-provided ETAs adjusted for seller handling times and region calendars. The system records status events (created, packed, picked_up, in_transit, out_for_delivery, delivered, exception) and surfaces them via order details and email/SMS notifications. For multi-seller orders, Shoplite shows per-seller shipment timelines and consolidated tracking when possible. The tracking API supports webhook updates from carriers to update status in near-real-time. Customers can request delivery changes (hold, reschedule) subject to carrier rules and seller acceptance. For lost or delayed shipments, Shoplite provides a claims workflow: customer contacts support → evidence collected (photos, timestamps) → seller/shipper investigation → refund or reship decision. Delivery exceptions escalate to support within 48 hours of detection.

## Document 06: Return and Refund Policies
Shoplite enforces a platform-level return window of 30 days from delivery for most categories, unless a seller-specific policy extends or restricts that window. Returns require a return authorization (RMA) which is generated when a return is initiated via the order page. Customers must provide reason codes and, for some categories (electronics, fragile), photos of defects. Return shipping labels can be generated by sellers or Shoplite (if the seller opts in); label costs are applied per agreement. Refunds are issued to the original payment method once the returned item is received and inspected or immediately if seller policy allows. For non-returnable items (perishable goods, custom-made products), refunds are handled case-by-case. For fraud prevention, Shoplite flags patterns of excessive returns from the same customer. Merchants can define restocking fees which are applied during refund calculation. The platform tracks return rates per SKU and provides merchants with analytics to reduce return causes.

## Document 07: Product Reviews and Ratings
Shoplite supports verified purchase reviews and star ratings (1-5). Verified reviews are labeled to indicate purchase verification. The review system allows text, optional photos, and attribute-specific ratings (e.g., fit, build-quality). Reviews are moderated: automated filters remove spam and profanity; flagged items are queued for manual review. Sellers can respond to reviews publicly. Aggregate ratings are computed with Bayesian smoothing to avoid early skew; average rating and total verified reviews are shown on product pages. Shoplite also supports Q&A sections where customers and sellers can answer product questions; answers by verified purchasers are highlighted. Abuse policies prohibit incentivized or fake reviews. The platform supports review reminders triggered after delivery if the customer consents. For legal compliance, Shoplite retains review metadata and stores audit logs of moderation actions.

## Document 08: Seller Account Setup and Management
Seller onboarding begins with business registration: business legal name, tax id, proof of identity for representative, bank payout info, and business address. Sellers choose store names, upload logos, and set return policies per-store. The seller dashboard includes inventory controls, order management, promotions, payout history, and performance analytics. Sellers can configure shipping methods: fixed-rate, weight-based, or integration with shipping providers. Payout schedule is configurable (daily, weekly) with settlement windows to accommodate chargeback risk. Sellers must adhere to marketplace policies (no prohibited items, correct product descriptions). Violations (intellectual property infringement, counterfeit goods) trigger warnings and possible removal. The platform provides APIs for sellers to update inventory (bulk CSV or API), manage listings (create/update), and receive webhook events for order lifecycle changes. There is also a support center for sellers with tiered SLAs based on program level.

## Document 09: Inventory Management for Sellers
Inventory management handles stock counts, SKU variants, and reservation during checkout. Sellers can set stock as centralized (global count) or multi-location (per-warehouse). Inventory holds occur at order confirmation to avoid overselling; holds expire if payment isn't completed within configured windows. Sellers can configure pre-order or backorder flags for out-of-stock items, with expected lead times displayed to buyers. The platform supports inventory sync via API or scheduled CSV imports; conflict resolution rules favor the most recent timestamp unless manual override is used. Threshold alerts for low stock can trigger notification emails and auto-reorder suggestions if sellers have supplier integrations. For multi-seller bundles or kits, stock is managed using component availability. Inventory reports provide sell-through rates, days-of-stock, and slow-moving SKU lists to help sellers plan procurement.

## Document 10: Commission and Fee Structure
Shoplite charges a commission on successful sales; commission percentages vary by category and seller program (standard vs. premium). Fees include: transaction commission, payment processing fee, optional fulfillment fees if Shoplite Fulfillment is used, and optional promotional/sponsored listing fees if sellers buy ad placements. Seller payouts net out commissions and refunds; payout statements provide line-item breakdown for each order. Fee schedule is transparent and available in seller agreements; Shoplite reserves the right to change fees with prior notice. For high-volume sellers, custom fee arrangements can be negotiated. Chargebacks and fraud losses may be deducted from payout reserves until resolved. Taxes on commissions may be applied depending on jurisdiction.

## Document 11: Customer Support Procedures
Shoplite offers multi-channel support: in-app chat, email, and phone for escalations. Support tiers vary (standard vs. premium). The customer support flow: user opens a ticket → automated triage attempts to resolve using FAQ and RAG-powered assistant → if unresolved, tickets escalate to human agents with priority based on issue severity and SLA. For order issues, support agents have access to order history, shipping events, and communication logs. Agents follow a knowledge base and templated responses to ensure consistent messaging. Escalations to sellers require seller response windows; if the seller doesn't respond, Shoplite may intervene. For fraud, specialized teams handle investigations. Support metrics include first-response time, time-to-resolution, and CSAT. Records of all support interactions are retained for training and audit purposes.

## Document 12: Mobile App Features
Shoplite mobile apps (iOS and Android) provide a streamlined buying experience with push notifications for order status, promotions, and cart reminders. Key features: biometric login, barcode scanning for price checks, camera-enabled review uploads, and offline browsing for saved catalogs. The app supports express checkout via saved payment tokens and one-tap reorder for recent purchases. Push notification preferences are user-configurable and follow OS guidelines. Mobile-specific UX includes swipeable product carousels and gestures to add items to cart. The app also supports seller notifications for new orders and returns. Performance optimizations include image lazy-loading, low-res placeholders, and caching strategy tuned for intermittent mobile connectivity.

## Document 13: API Documentation for Developers
Shoplite provides a RESTful API with endpoints for products, orders, customers, inventory, and webhooks. Authentication uses OAuth2 for third-party apps and API keys for server-to-server integrations. Rate limits are tiered by developer program. Endpoints return JSON with consistent schema versioning; breaking changes are communicated through the developer portal. Webhooks cover order lifecycle events, payment events, and inventory updates. SDKs in Python and Node are provided to simplify integration. The API supports pagination, field projection, and filtering; responses include HATEOAS links for navigation. The developer portal has sandbox credentials and sample payloads for testing.

## Document 14: Security and Privacy Policies
Shoplite is committed to user data protection and privacy. Data handling follows regional privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA) where applicable. PII is minimized and encrypted at rest; access controls enforce least privilege. Security controls: network isolation, application layer WAF, regular penetration testing, and incident response playbooks. Data retention policies vary by data type; transaction and order data are retained for compliance, while marketing preferences are retained per user consent. Shoplite issues privacy notices and allows users to request data exports or deletions subject to legal exceptions. Vendors and partners undergo security assessments to ensure appropriate safeguards.

## Document 15: Promotional Codes and Discounts
Shoplite supports flexible promo engines for percentage discounts, fixed-amount discounts, free-shipping, and buy-X-get-Y offers. Promotions can be targeted (first-time buyers, cart value thresholds, specific buyer segments), time-limited, or tied to seller campaigns. Coupons can be single-use or multi-use and may be stackable or exclusive based on configuration. Merchant-level controls allow sellers to create and manage promotions subject to platform policies. Promotion eligibility is determined at checkout, and the applied discounts break down line-item to simplify reconciliation. Promo analytics show redemption rates, incremental sales, and campaign ROI. Fraud measures limit promo abuse (velocity checks, per-account limits).
